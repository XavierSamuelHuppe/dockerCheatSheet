##Everything

### Starting and Stopping

* [`docker start`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start) starts a container so it is running.
* [`docker stop`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop) stops a running container.
* [`docker restart`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/restart) stops and starts a container.
* [`docker pause`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pause/) pauses a running container, "freezing" it in place.
* [`docker unpause`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/unpause/) will unpause a running container.
* [`docker wait`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/wait) blocks until running container stops.
* [`docker kill`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/kill) sends a SIGKILL to a running container.
* [`docker attach`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach) will connect to a running container.


### Lifecycle

* [`docker create`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create) creates a container but does not start it.
* [`docker rename`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rename/) allows the container to be renamed.
* [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run) creates and starts a container in one operation.
* [`docker rm`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm) deletes a container.
* [`docker update`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/update/) updates a container's resource limits.

### Info

* [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps) shows running containers.
* [`docker logs`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs) gets logs from container.  (You can use a custom log driver, but logs is only available for `json-file` and `journald` in 1.10).
* [`docker inspect`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect) looks at all the info on a container (including IP address).
* [`docker events`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events) gets events from container.
* [`docker port`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/port) shows public facing port of container.
* [`docker top`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/top) shows running processes in container.
* [`docker stats`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stats) shows containers' resource usage statistics.
* [`docker diff`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/diff) shows changed files in the container's FS.

### Lifecycle

* [`docker images`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images) shows all images.
* [`docker import`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import) creates an image from a tarball.
* [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build) creates image from Dockerfile.
* [`docker commit`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit) creates image from a container, pausing it temporarily if it is running.
* [`docker rmi`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rmi) removes an image.
* [`docker load`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load) loads an image from a tar archive as STDIN, including images and tags (as of 0.7).
* [`docker save`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save) saves an image to a tar archive stream to STDOUT with all parent layers, tags & versions (as of 0.7).

## Registry & Repository

* [`docker login`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login) to login to a registry.
* [`docker logout`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logout) to logout from a registry.
* [`docker search`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/search) searches registry for image.
* [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull) pulls an image from registry to local machine.
* [`docker push`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push) pushes an image to the registry from local machine.
